        <h1>🌦️ GENERAL TRAVEL ADVICE</h1>
        <img src="Images/monsoons2.jpg" alt="Sri Lanka weather map" class="section-img">
        <div class="content-text">
            <h2>🔸Understand the weather before planning your trip</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka’s tropical climate means it’s sunny all year, but the country experiences two different monsoon seasons.
            The Southwest Monsoon (May to September) brings rain to the southern and western coasts, while the Northeast Monsoon (November to February) affects the northern and eastern sides.
            Visit Colombo, Galle, Mirissa, and Bentota from December to April, and explore Trincomalee, Jaffna, and Arugam Bay from May to October.</p>

            <h2>🔸Plan fewer destinations but explore deeply</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka may look small on a map, but the winding roads, mountains, and traffic can make travel time longer than expected. Instead of rushing through ten towns in a week, spend time in each place to enjoy local life and hidden gems.</p>

            <h2>🔸Stay hydrated and eat safely</h2>
            <p>The heat can be strong, especially in coastal and dry areas. Always drink bottled, filtered, or boiled water. Avoid drinking directly from taps, especially in remote towns. When eating street food, choose stalls that are busy and clean.</p>

            <h2>🔸Carry small cash notes</h2>
            <p>Many shops, tuk-tuks, and street vendors do not accept card payments. Always keep small notes in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) for easy transactions. Larger restaurants, supermarkets, and hotels usually accept credit or debit cards.</p>

            <h2>🔸Mobile and internet</h2>
            <p>Get a Dialog, Mobitel, or Airtel SIM card at the airport. Data packages are affordable, and the signal is reliable even in rural areas.</p>

        <h1>🙏 CULTURE & ETIQUETTE</h1>
        <img src="Images/respect.jpg" alt="Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka" class="section-img">
        <div class="content-text">
            <h2>🔹Dress modestly at temples and religious sites</h2>
            <p>Shoulders and knees must be covered. Remove shoes and hats before entering any Buddhist or Hindu temple.</p>

            <h2>🔹Respect Buddhist symbols</h2>
            <p>Never take photos with your back turned to a Buddha statue. Avoid touching or pointing directly at religious images.</p>

            <h2>🔹Greetings and manners</h2>
            <p>The traditional greeting is “Ayubowan”, made with palms together and a slight bow. A friendly smile goes a long way — Sri Lankans are warm and welcoming.</p>

            <h2>🔹Right-hand etiquette</h2>
            <p>Always use your right hand for giving or receiving money, gifts, or food. The left hand is considered unclean.</p>

            <h2>🔹Public behavior</h2>
            <p>Public displays of affection such as kissing or hugging are discouraged in rural areas or religious sites.</p>

        <h1>🚗 TRANSPORTATION TIPS</h1>
        <img src="Images/tuktuks.jpg" alt="Sri Lankan tuktuks" class="section-img">
        <div class="content-text">
            <h2>🔸Tuk-tuks (three-wheelers)</h2>
            <p>Tuk-tuks are the most convenient and fun way to travel short distances. Always check if the tuk-tuk has a meter. If not, negotiate the fare before starting the ride. The PickMe app is widely used in major cities like Colombo, Kandy, and Galle and provides fair rates and GPS tracking.</p>

            <h2>🔸Trains</h2>
            <p>The train journeys in Sri Lanka are famous worldwide for their scenic views, especially the route between Kandy and Ella that passes through tea plantations and misty hills.
            Book tickets in advance for first or second class seats. If you love photography, the observation carriage offers wide windows for breathtaking shots.</p>

            <h2>🔸Buses</h2>
            <p>Public buses are cheap and frequent but can get crowded. For long distances, take semi-luxury or air-conditioned buses, which are more comfortable. City buses are fast and may stop anywhere, so hold on tight.</p>

            <h2>🔸Private cars and drivers</h2>
            <p>Hiring a driver is common and affordable. Self-driving is possible but not recommended unless you are confident in unpredictable traffic conditions.</p>

        <img src="Images/goyabokka.jpg" alt="Goyabokka beach" class="section-img">
        
        <div class="content-text">
            <h2>🔹Cultural Triangle</h2>
            <p>Visit Sigiriya, the ancient rock fortress; Dambulla Cave Temple; and the sacred cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, which display Sri Lanka’s rich history and architecture.</p>

            <h2>🔹Hill Country</h2>
            <p>The cool, green heart of Sri Lanka. Visit Kandy for culture, Nuwara Eliya for colonial charm, and Ella for scenic hikes and waterfalls.</p>

            <h2>🔹Beaches</h2>
            <p>For relaxation, the south coast (Unawatuna, Mirissa, Tangalle) is perfect between December and April.
            For surfing or a peaceful swim, head east to Arugam Bay or Nilaveli between May and October.</p>

            <h2>🔹Wildlife and nature</h2>
            <p>Go on a safari in Yala National Park to see leopards, or visit Minneriya for the elephant gathering during the dry season.
            Wilpattu is quieter and offers a more natural experience.</p>

            <h2>🔹Hidden gems</h2>
            <p>Explore Knuckles Mountain Range for hiking and waterfalls, Kalpitiya for dolphin watching and kitesurfing, and Mannar for unique desert-like scenery.</p>

            <h2>🔹Festivals and culture</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kandy Esala Perahera (July/August): A grand parade of dancers, drummers, and elephants.</li>
                <li>Sinhala & Tamil New Year (April): Traditional games, sweets, and family celebrations.</li>
                <li>Deepavali (October/November): The Hindu festival of lights celebrated with lamps and sweets.</li>
