        <h2>A Hands-On Guide to the Tiny Computers All Around Us!</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Fun with Embedded Systems! This site is your starting point for exploring the fascinating world of embedded systems—the small, specialized computers that are hidden inside countless devices we use every day. From the smart thermostat on your wall to the engine controller in your car, these tiny brains are everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. They are designed to do a specific job, making them highly efficient and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this site, we'll dive into the basics of how these systems work and introduce you to some popular platforms that make it easy to start building your own projects. Each of our sub-pages will explore a different platform, giving you the knowledge you need to start experimenting.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't need a lot of prior experience to get started. All you need is curiosity and a desire to build cool things. We'll show you how to start with simple projects and work your way up to more complex and exciting creations.
